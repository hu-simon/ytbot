        This version of ytbot requires Python {}.{} but you are attempting to install it on Python {}.{}.

        You may also be using a version of pip that doesn't understand the python_requires classifier. Make sure that you have pip >= 9.0 and setuptools >= 24.2, and try installing the package again. The following command allows you to do this.

        $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
        $ python -m pip install -e .

        This will install the latest version of pip, setuptools, and ytbot. Older versions of ytbot may be available but are at end-of-life support.
