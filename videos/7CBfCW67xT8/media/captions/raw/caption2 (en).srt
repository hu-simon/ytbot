[Music]

3
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:19,289
I'm a psychologist and a neuroscientist

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,250
by training when I first began my career

5
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:25,890
I began with a question why is it that

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,680
some people are more vulnerable to

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,110
life's slings and arrows and others more

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,870
resilient and that question is still

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,989
central to all the work that we do and

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:41,070
we are particularly interested in how we

11
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:43,590
can nudge people along this continuum to

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,219
nourish and nurture the qualities that

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,379
promote human flourishing in the early

14
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,429
part of my career I focused almost

15
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,949
exclusively on the negative side of the

16
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:58,050
equation on adversity on the brain

17
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,600
circuits that were important for

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,870
understanding why some people are more

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,200
vulnerable to stress why others may be

20
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,580
more likely to develop a depression or

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,940
anxiety and then something very

22
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:18,050
significant happened in my life in 1992

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:22,470
I first met his Holiness the Dalai Lama

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:25,800
and this picture of his holiness was

25
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:29,910
taken in Madison Wisconsin and he's

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,670
visited us several times and he was the

27
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:35,550
chief inspiration in our turning toward

28
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,480
the positive and in that critical moment

29
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:42,540
in 1992 he challenged me and he said why

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:46,680
can't you use the same tools of modern

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,850
neuroscience to study kindness and to

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,700
study compassion in addition to studying

33
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:56,220
anxiety and fear and depression and

34
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,960
stress and I didn't have a very good

35
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,410
answer for him on that day

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,530
other than that it's hard but you know

37
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,090
when we first began to study kindness we

38
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,950
first began to study anxiety and

39
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:13,500
depression that was hard too and we've

40
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:15,840
made some progress in that area so the

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,409
work that we and others have been doing

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,670
is predicated on a critical insight in

43
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:25,370
modern science the insight concerning

44
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,280
neuroplasticity our brain

45
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,819
are constantly changing constantly being

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:35,060
shaped by the forces around us but we

47
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:37,549
have typically very little awareness of

48
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,400
what those forces are our brains are

49
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:42,680
changing wittingly or unwittingly most

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,680
of the time it's unwittingly most of the

51
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,650
time were not aware and we also have

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,720
little control over those forces and the

53
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,420
invitation in the work that I'm sharing

54
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,150
with you today is that we can actually

55
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,319
take more responsibility for our own

56
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:02,900
brains by transforming our minds but

57
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,390
first let me share with you what some of

58
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,970
the consequences of having our brains

59
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,489
being shaped unwittingly are and I'd

60
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:13,760
like to focus on four challenges that

61
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:17,900
have been critical in our society today

62
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,930
and these challenges are failures of

63
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:24,829
well-being in very important ways the

64
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:30,650
first is distractibility research

65
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:33,829
indicates that if we take people out and

66
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,750
about in the world and we text them and

67
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:37,760
this has been done in a study that was

68
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,769
published a number of years ago very

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,049
influential study with several thousand

70
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:44,299
people we text them when we asked them

71
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:46,069
three questions the first question is

72
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:47,959
what are you doing right now

73
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:51,260
and they check off from a list of

74
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:54,949
activities second question where is your

75
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,810
mind right now is it focused on what

76
00:03:54,949 --> 00:04:00,019
you're doing or is it focused elsewhere

77
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:03,609
and the third question is at this very

78
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:07,040
moment how happy or unhappy are you

79
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:11,329
here's what was found the average

80
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,690
American adult spends forty seven

81
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:16,900
percent of her or his waking life not

82
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,430
paying attention to what we're doing

83
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,940
folks

84
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,940
we could do better

85
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,680
and when they were not paying attention

86
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,310
to what they're doing they were

87
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,410
significantly less happy the scientific

88
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:37,580
paper upon which this is based

89
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:44,300
was titled a wandering mind is an

90
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:48,140
unhappy mind in addition there is a huge

91
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:50,240
increase in the incidence of attention

92
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:54,440
deficit disorders in children in this

93
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,340
country this is a graph showing a trend

94
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,830
over the last decade there are many

95
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:03,440
reasons for this increase but some of

96
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:06,740
them have to do with a genuine increase

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,980
in distractibility if we're all honest

98
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:13,340
with ourselves our nation is suffering

99
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:17,570
not simply from a fiscal deficit but

100
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:20,030
from an attention deficit we also are

101
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,950
suffering from loneliness despite the

102
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:25,040
fact that we're all so much more

103
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:27,770
interconnected 76% of middle-aged

104
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,870
Americans report that they have moderate

105
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,550
to high levels of loneliness and this

106
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,700
loneliness is not an ephemeral

107
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:41,720
subjective state it also impacts our

108
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:44,180
bodies our physical health recent

109
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,960
research shows that loneliness is

110
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:50,960
actually a more significant predictor by

111
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,770
more than a two-fold magnitude of early

112
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:59,270
mortality compared to obesity

113
00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:02,750
so this exacts real tolls on our brains

114
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:06,340
and our bodies and again research shows

115
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,340
we can do better

116
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,980
negative self-talk in depression we all

117
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,730
have a narrative in our mind that we

118
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:19,220
carry around about who we are and

119
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:21,830
sometimes we have negative beliefs about

120
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:25,160
ourselves which can culminate in

121
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,650
depression and this turns out to be a

122
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,320
very serious problem depression is on

123
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:33,180
the rise if you look at trends just over

124
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,430
the last few years what you see is

125
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,310
is a very large increase particularly

126
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,729
among women over the last three years

127
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:44,580
alone there's been a 33 percent increase

128
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:47,130
in diagnosis of major depression in

129
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,509
women and this trend is occurring in

130
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,949
teens as well

131
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:56,190
these are disturbing trends in kids ages

132
00:06:52,949 --> 00:07:01,500
12 through 17 and the gender difference

133
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:03,360
also is very unfortunately robust where

134
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,310
the incidence is much greater and

135
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,099
females and this trend is getting worse

136
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,770
over time and again the evidence

137
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:13,080
suggests that we can actually train our

138
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:18,449
mind and harness the power of

139
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:22,669
neuroplasticity to change these these

140
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:25,289
qualities in our mind suicide rates are

141
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:27,240
very disturbing during the Great

142
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:29,940
Depression there was a huge elevation

143
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,789
and those rates have come back down and

144
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:36,539
then since the year 2000 there has been

145
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:38,599
unfortunately a steep rise in suicide

146
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,680
rates and again this is not something

147
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,919
restricted to adults

148
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,010
our teams are showing more than doubling

149
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,830
over the last ten years in suicide so

150
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,180
that today in the United States

151
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,180
unfortunately more than one teenager

152
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,479
every single day is taking her or his

153
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,789
own life

154
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:03,270
there also is a pervasive loss of

155
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:08,460
meaning and purpose that people are

156
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:11,789
reporting and this loss is not simply

157
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:15,720
again a subjective quality but also

158
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:18,780
exacts a toll on our health and other

159
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,970
aspects of our well-being research shows

160
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,180
that a lack of purpose predicts an early

161
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,340
death in a recent study people who are

162
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,280
in their 60s with a low sense of purpose

163
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,070
had more than twice likelihood of dying

164
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,479
within five years compared to people who

165
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:38,940
reported a high sense of purpose so

166
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:42,000
again there are intimate connections

167
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,510
between our psychological well-being and

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,980
our systemic health each of these

169
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,340
challenges affect

170
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:54,090
the mind and the brain were not thriving

171
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:58,200
but the invitation is that we really

172
00:08:54,090 --> 00:09:01,320
could be so we've developed a framework

173
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,160
for understanding a healthy mind and

174
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,830
this framework includes four pillars the

175
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,250
first pillar is awareness and awareness

176
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:15,540
includes the capacity to focus our

177
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:18,690
attention to resist distraction it also

178
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,420
includes a quality that psychologists

179
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:25,170
and neuroscientists call meta awareness

180
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,470
meta awareness is knowing what our minds

181
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:31,260
are doing how many of you have ever had

182
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,950
the experience of reading a book where

183
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:38,850
you're reading each word on a page and

184
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:42,090
you read one page you may read a second

185
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:45,710
page and after a few minutes you have

186
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:50,640
absolutely no idea what you've just read

187
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:53,780
that is an example of a lapse in met

188
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,630
awareness but the moment we recognize

189
00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:00,480
that we've been lost and come back that

190
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:03,030
is a moment of meta awareness and we

191
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,670
have reason to believe that met

192
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:08,370
awareness is crucial actually it's

193
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,850
necessary we believe for real

194
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:15,830
transformation to occur the second

195
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:18,780
pillar of a healthy mind is connection

196
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:22,350
connection refers to those qualities

197
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,510
which nurture harmonious interpersonal

198
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,660
relationships

199
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:30,300
qualities like appreciation like

200
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,180
kindness like compassion having a

201
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:36,810
positive outlook and again the research

202
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:40,410
shows that it doesn't take much to start

203
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:44,970
activating these latent qualities which

204
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:48,150
can flourish and become stronger the

205
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:52,290
third pillar of a healthy mind is

206
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:55,320
insight and insight is about insight

207
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:59,550
into the narrative that we all have

208
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,920
about ourselves at the very extreme end

209
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,959
of

210
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,970
continuum there are people who have a

211
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:06,249
very negative narrative they have

212
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,139
negative self-beliefs and they hold

213
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:11,079
those beliefs to be a true description

214
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:14,049
of who they are that is a prescription

215
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:17,529
for depression and a healthy mind

216
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:19,899
entails changing our relationship to

217
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:22,209
this narrative not so much changing the

218
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:24,819
narrative itself but changing our

219
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:26,859
relationship to it so that we can look

220
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:28,529
at the narrative and see it for what it

221
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:31,480
is

222
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:34,209
what is this narrative it's a

223
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:38,290
constellation of thoughts and when we

224
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:42,790
can see it is that we can foster more

225
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:45,839
room more breathing room and lead to and

226
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:49,540
this leads to increased well-being

227
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:53,259
finally the last pillar of a healthy

228
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:55,389
mind is purpose and here we're talking

229
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:58,119
about having a sense that our life is

230
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:02,499
headed in a particular direction and

231
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:04,809
most importantly it is about taking more

232
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:08,069
and more of the activities in our lives

233
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:11,559
as belonging to this sense of purpose

234
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:14,259
can you envision living your life so

235
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:16,749
that taking out the garbage and doing

236
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:20,079
the laundry is still related to your

237
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:23,499
sense of purpose being able to broaden

238
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:27,329
it in this way is a very crucial

239
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:32,860
ingredient of a healthy mind

240
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:36,910
have you ever trained your mind research

241
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:39,009
from neuroscience leads us to understand

242
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,649
that there are two fundamentally

243
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:43,480
different kinds of learning one form of

244
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:46,779
learning we call declarative learning

245
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,720
which is learning about things I can

246
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:52,119
learn the value of kindness by sitting

247
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,539
down and studying texts about kindness

248
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:58,689
but this won't necessarily lead us to

249
00:12:55,539 --> 00:13:00,999
become kinder we can teach people the

250
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:02,859
value of honesty but this will not

251
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:07,179
necessarily make them an honest person

252
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:08,919
in order to cultivate these qualities we

253
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,470
need a second form of learning and that

254
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:12,410
is called

255
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,629
procedural learning

256
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,639
neuroscience teaches us that these kinds

257
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:20,819
of learning operate through totally

258
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:24,360
different brain circuits we need both to

259
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:26,069
produce real transformation the wiring

260
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,319
in our brains is not fixed it's

261
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:31,259
adaptable and we can harness the power

262
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:35,009
of neuroplasticity to change our brain

263
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:37,769
let me give you one example this is an

264
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:40,410
example from research that we did where

265
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:42,689
we randomized people to a group that

266
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,670
received compassion training for two

267
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:47,279
weeks another group that received

268
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:50,129
training from cognitive therapy we put

269
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,649
people in the MRI scanner before and

270
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:55,350
after the two weeks of training and lo

271
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:58,619
and behold we see systematic differences

272
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:03,149
after just seven hours of practice our

273
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:06,119
brains can change in a remarkably rapid

274
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:08,339
period of time the changes that are

275
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:10,889
displayed here it changes in a circuit

276
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:13,829
that involved the prefrontal cortex and

277
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:16,110
the ventral striatum a circuit very

278
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:18,809
important for certain kinds of positive

279
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:22,079
emotions which gets strengthened after

280
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:24,959
just this short amount of practice so

281
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,509
these and other kinds of data indicate

282
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,549
that the brain really can change quite

283
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:32,670
quickly it doesn't mean that these

284
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:35,519
changes will last but it means that they

285
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:38,970
can be that they can occur they can

286
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:42,269
begin and with systematic practice they

287
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:45,720
will endure we view this as an urgent

288
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:49,470
public health need so we need to start

289
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,990
someplace I would recommend three

290
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,360
minutes a day when human beings first

291
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:58,259
evolved on this planet none of us were

292
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:02,279
brushing our teeth and yet today we all

293
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:03,720
do this is not part of our genome this

294
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:08,720
is a learned behavior

295
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:13,860
and it doesn't take much to start these

296
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:16,139
mechanisms in the brain to change so we

297
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,579
can do this when we're doing other

298
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,559
things we can do this while we're

299
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:22,319
commuting we can do this as we're

300
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,970
literally brushing our teeth we can do

301
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:25,559
this

302
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,160
as we're having our first cup of coffee

303
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,990
or

304
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,779
tea in the morning we can do this as

305
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:36,149
we're walking this can be incorporated

306
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:39,060
in routines of our daily life so we can

307
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:42,089
nourish our mind and through it we can

308
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,610
change the world we can reduce implicit

309
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:46,439
bias bias that gets under the skin this

310
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,620
is something that we've shown can occur

311
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:52,019
with strengthening connection we can

312
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,560
increase school achievement and we've

313
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:58,889
and others have shown this with training

314
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,439
and awareness we can reduce healthcare

315
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:04,350
costs potentially by cultivating

316
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:08,310
well-being as the connections that I've

317
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:10,639
Illustrated show we can cultivate a

318
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:13,069
strong sense of purpose we can reduce

319
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:17,040
distraction and we can increase

320
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:20,670
productivity and focus and I'd like to

321
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,040
end with just a one-minute short period

322
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:26,009
of practice to give you an experience

323
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,500
I'll taste of this so if you all just

324
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:33,149
sit for a moment put down your pens and

325
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:37,220
devices and I invite you to bring a

326
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:39,990
loved one into your mind in your heart

327
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,939
you can leave your eyes open or closed

328
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,670
and for those who are viewing this

329
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:49,410
online please share this one-minute with

330
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:53,339
us and as you bring this loved one into

331
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:56,069
your mind in your heart cultivate the

332
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:59,759
strong aspiration that they be happy and

333
00:16:56,069 --> 00:17:02,459
be free of suffering and they share the

334
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,679
same wish for happiness and the same

335
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:08,130
wish to be free of suffering as all

336
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,169
human beings and you can envision a time

337
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,020
in their life when they maybe may have

338
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:15,839
been having some difficulty and you can

339
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,309
say a simple phrase in your mind may you

340
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:25,709
be happy may you be free of suffering

341
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:28,049
and simply notice whatever may come up

342
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,960
for you and then we can do this from

343
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:35,039
many categories of people including a

344
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,830
difficult person so I invite you to join

345
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,450
us on this journey and the very future

346
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,030
of humanity

347
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,700
we think depends on it thank you very

348
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,170
much

349
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,170
[Applause]

350
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,750
[Applause]
