Hello, I'm Bob Ross. And I'd like to welcome you.

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,349
First of all, let me take a moment just to thank you for allowing me back into your homes.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,349
If this is your first time with us, let me extend a personal invitation

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,349
For you to drag out your oil paints and paint along with us each week.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,349
Let's go to the canvas over week here and get started.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,849
I believe, I believe

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,349
Every day is a good day when you paint.

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,349
I believe, I believe

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,349
It'll bring a lot of good thoughts to your heart

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,349
I believe, I believe, every day's a good when you paint

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,349
I believe, I believe, It'll bring a lot of good thoughts to your heart

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,349
Let's build a happy little cloud; let's build some happy little trees

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,349
There are no limits here

14
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,349
Start out by believing here

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,349
you can almost paint with anything

16
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,349
all you have to do is practice

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,349
There are no limits here

18
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,849
Start out by believing here

19
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,349
This is your world, you're the creator; find freedom on this canvas

20
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,349
Believe that you can do it, because you can do it.

21
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:22,349
Give it a little touch, give it a little push; make love to the canvas.

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,349
Give it a little touch, give it a little push; caress it, very gentle.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,349
Grab it, lift it, fluff it; you can go on and on and on

24
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,349
back and forth, layer after layer

25
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,349
Let's build a happy little cloud; let's build some happy little trees

26
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:50,349
There are no limits here. Start out by believing here.

27
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,349
This is your world, you're the creator; find freedom on this canvas

28
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,349
Believe that you can do it, because you can do it.

29
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,349
Relax, let it flow, think like water

30
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,349
Relax, let it flow, you can go on and on and on

31
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,349
We don't make mistakes; just happy accidents.

32
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,349
You can do anything that you want to do, total power.

33
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,349
Sing along, have a good time:

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:34,349
Do do do

35
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,349
This is your world, you're the creator; find freedom on this canvas

36
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,349
Believe that you can do it, because you can do it.

37
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,349
I believe, I believe, that every day's a good day when you paint

38
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,349
I believe, I believe it'll bring a lot of good thoughts to your heart

39
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,349
I believe, I believe every day's a good day when you paint

40
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:10,349
I believe, I believe it'll bring a lot of good thoughts to your heart
